    <b><u><big>Unit One Summary</big></u></b>
<br>Computers are stupid.
<br>Everyone has their special talents, computers are good at crunching stuff, not trying to figure out what you mean when you only say half of what you mean.
<br>
<br>
<b>Big take-aways</b>
<br>
The web is made up of a bunch of documents created with HTML, but there are lots of other files contained within the HTML files.
<br>
Even though there are lots of great html markups that I learned, I can't figure out how to add them here without making them do their thing. I will provide a synopsis instead.
<br>
<br>
<b>HTML Markup</b>
<br>
HTML is the heart of the web. HTML makes up everything you can see on a webpage and links to other webpages (which makes the web webby).
<br>
Tags like "em" and "b" add some style to the fonts that appear on the webpage.
<br>
Attributes are used to add links to the page using "a href" and closing with "a"
<br>
Perhaps the easiest way to relieve frustration when typing text in HTML is the Break and Pagraph tags
<br>
If it weren't for these two tags, all the text on every webpage would run together like crazy and be super hard to read.
<br>
The internet would certainly not be as nice to see if all the text was smushed together.
<br>
One other important note about HTML is that there is a standard for opening and closing HTML files so the internet can read them. This is a standard for all webpages on the internet.
<br>
<br>
<b>I am glad I have a computer</b>
<br>
Through the use of web browsers communicating with the internet communicating with servers hidden in closets, I am part of an incredible generation that has shrunk the world.
<br>
I am very excited to join my comrads in this incredible journey into the future.
